### Project Objective
---
  - The objectives of this project are to:
  - Analyze total revenue generated and units sold across different stores, 
    markets, and regions.
  - Identify trends and patterns in sales performance based on geographic and 
    demographic factors.
  - Compare performance metrics between regions to highlight best practices and 
    areas needing improvement.
  - Provide recommendations for targeted marketing and sales strategies based on 
    analysis results.

 ### PREPROCESSING STEPS
 ---
- Data Cleaning: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and ensure data 
       consistency.
- Data Transformation: Convert data types as needed (e.g., dates, numeric 
       values) and aggregate sales data by store, market, and region.
- Time-frame Selection: Define the period for analysis (e.g., One month, two 
     months).

 ### DATA ANALYSIS   
In this section queries are written to obtain some data;

```
SELECT * FROM TABLE 1
WHERE REGION = "North Central"

SELECT * FROM TABLE 2
WHERE STORE = "Ankpa" and SUM OF REVENUE = "1.7BN"

SELECT * FROM TABLE 3
WHERE REVENUE > 100560.934
 ```


### Visual Analysis and Inference Visualizations:
---
  - Bar Charts: Display total revenue and units sold by store, market, and region.
  - Heatmaps: Visualize sales performance across different regions to identify 
   high and low-performing areas.
  - Line Charts: Show sales trends over time to highlight seasonal variations.


### Insights
---
- Summarize key findings from the visual analysis, such as:
 - Regions or markets with the highest and lowest sales.
 - Correlation between store size/type and sales performance.
 - Seasonal trends impacting sales in specific regions.
   
### Key Metrics
---
- Total Revenue: Overall revenue generated across all stores and regions during the analysis period.
- Total Units Sold: Total number of products sold, aggregated by store and region.
- Average Revenue per Store: Total revenue divided by the number of stores in each region.
- Revenue Growth Rate: Percentage change in revenue over time (e.g., month-over-month or year-over-year).
